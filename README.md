  Simply investing calculator- all what you need to keep on pace with changing exchange rates
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
About:
  Program grabs info about cryptocurrencys, currencys and resources values on market, everything is stored in excel file.
The second functionality is ability to add how many goods user has in which means, it's automatically converted to actuall value.
The third functioanlity is that script automatically generates some calculations over your data. Program gives an interface both command based and GUI o which you can operate
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
How to install it:
-You need to add autoActualization.py to your task scheduler. Program is set to be actualize 3 times a day, so you need to make 3 tasks.
I recommend you to set the time to 8AM 16PM and Midnight. 
-To see effects run ControlPanel.py or GUI.py, it depends which interface u prefer
-I added some .xlsx files, which are needed if you want to make tests of this code, the sholud be placed in TestCopies directory
*****************************************************************************************************************************************
  Program has some tests which you can use while modifying it. Unfortunetly i hadn't known pytest when I started this project so every test is written using simply functions. However making some modifications sholudn't be hard. Also code organization could have been better especially placing test in code.
  GUI- gui is very simple, and i'm not proud of how it looks, however it works fine. It doesn't offer as many options as command based interface, it's a prototype

Future:
  I've done everything i wanted in this project, so i don't plan to develop it further, however there is possibility that i would like to pracitse some new- learned functions on it like data visualization with matplotlib, or testing. 
  Adding some sript which will automate instalation is a nice option in the future
