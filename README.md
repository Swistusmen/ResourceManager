How to install it:
-You need to add autoActualization.py to your task scheduler. Program is set to be actualize 3 times a day, so you need to make 3 tasks.
I recommend you to set the time to 8AM 16PM and Midnight. 
-To see effects run ControlPanel.py
-I added some .xlsx files, which are needed if you want to make tests of this code, the sholud be placed in TestCopies directory

In the future:
-Add some gui to make everything looks cleaner
-find out how to make program auto actualized itself, without operations on task scheeduler
